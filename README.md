# LibreHealthSync

LibreHealthSync is a small app I created to fill in a couple of feature gaps in Abbott's official app, namely writing blood glucose data to HealthKit, and providing a Live Activity widget that periodically updates. These features were borrowed from [GlucoseDirect](https://github.com/creepymonster/GlucoseDirect), but this app works alongside the regular Abbott app instead of attempting to replace it.

## Disclaimers

**Unofficial API:** This app uses an unofficial, reverse-engineered Abbott LibreLinkUp API. It is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or supported by Abbott Laboratories. The API may change or stop working at any time without notice.

**Not a Medical Device:** This app is not a medical device and must not be used to make medical decisions. Always rely on your official glucose monitor and consult your healthcare provider for medical guidance.

**No Warranty:** This app is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind. The developer assumes no liability for any damages or issues arising from its use.

**Data & Credentials:** Your LibreLinkUp credentials are stored locally in the iOS Keychain on your device. Glucose data is transmitted to and from Abbott's servers as part of the normal LibreLinkUp API flow.

**Use at Your Own Risk:** By using this application, you acknowledge that you understand and accept the risks associated with using this unofficial application.
